	<p class="desc">
		Object-oriented programming is a type of language that uses objects, which you create, to store methods and functions that act upon that object. For example, you could make a Fish object(note the capitalization, that will be important for later) and write methods that allow it to swim. You could write a swim left function so the fish can go left, and functions to help the fish swim right, up, down, and any other direction you may want it to go.

		But before we start writing functions, we need to learn some basics first!
